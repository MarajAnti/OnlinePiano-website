<p>Have you ever tried teaching yourself piano? Maybe you tried following
     long online video lessons but got frustrated at having to stop to pause and rewind as you learned a piece.
      Or maybe you bought books and sheet music but it took months of practice before you could play even the most 
      basic songs.

    What if there were a better way to learn to play piano? We think there is – and that’s why we created flowkey.
     It makes learning piano quicker, easier, and much more rewarding. You can follow piano lessons online that
      listen as you practice and let you know if you’re playing correctly. This way you'll learn to play your 
      favorite songs faster than ever. From reading music to mastering chords and playing all the greatest hits – 
    flowkey will help you become the pianist you always wanted to be.</p>


<p>As we give a lot of freedom, we rely on the intrinsic motivation of our people
     to do the best work they can and grow both personally and professionally. 
     The people we attract seek critical feedback, are open to other perspectives and see challenges as an opportunity for growth. 
    We further promote growth by giving you a yearly budget of up to €2,500 for personal and professional development.</p>


<p>We all have unique life circumstances, needs, and preferences. 
    That's why you're free to work wherever you want and whenever you're most productive. 
    At the same time, we recognize that with freedom comes responsibility towards ourselves. 
    It takes self-awareness and strength to take responsibility for your own development.
