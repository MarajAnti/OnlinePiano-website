<p>Have you ever tried teaching yourself piano? 
    Maybe you tried following long online video lessons but got frustrated at having to stop to pause and rewind as you learned a piece.
     Or maybe you bought books and sheet music but it took months of practice before you could play even the most basic songs.

    there is – and that’s why we created flowkey. It makes learning piano quicker,
